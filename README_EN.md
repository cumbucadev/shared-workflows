## What's in here?

This repository stores standardized workflows that can be reused in other repositories within the organization using the [`workflow_call`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows) feature.

Here you'll find:

- Standardized CI/CD workflows
- Automation flows for testing, building, and deployment
- Shared conventions across projects

## How to use in other repositories

You can reuse workflows from this repository in other projects by adding a snippet like the one
below to your `.github/workflows/<name>.yml` file:

```yml
permissions: <permissions>

jobs:
  example:
    uses: cumbucadev/shared-workflows/.github/workflows/<workflow-name.yml>@main
```

Replace `<permissions>` with the required permissions and `<workflow-name>` with the desired
workflow file.

Real example of use:

```yml
permissions:
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  example:
    uses: cumbucadev/shared-workflows/.github/workflows/validate-pr-title-v1.yml@main
```

## Catalog

Below are the shared workflows currently used across the Cumbuca org. We version **by major in the
filename** (e.g., `-v1`, `-v2`). See the changelogs for breaking changes and migration notes.

### autoassign-issue

#### Description

This workflow automatically assigns an issue to a user when they comment a **specific keyword** on the issue.
The comment works as a trigger of ‚ÄúI want to take this issue,‚Äù making the self-assignment process simple, fast, and transparent.
Additionally, the workflow posts a bilingual (English + Portuguese) comment confirming that the issue has been assigned to the user.

#### Triggers

- `issue_comment` (created)

#### Keywords (triggers)

- `"bora"`, `"bora!"`, `"dibs"`, `"dibs!"`
  _(case-insensitive ‚Äî any combination of uppercase/lowercase letters is accepted)_

#### Behavior Summary

- When someone comments one of the trigger keywords on an open issue:
  - The issue is automatically assigned to that user
  - A bilingual comment is posted confirming the assignment and including a link to the contributing guide
- Helps streamline the contribution process, avoiding manual assignee management and improving visibility of who is working on each issue

#### Changelog

- **v1** ‚Äî Initial release
  - Implements autoassign for comments containing specific trigger keywords
  - Supported keywords: `"bora"`, `"bora!"`, `"dibs"`, `"dibs!"`
  - Posts a bilingual confirmation comment (PT-BR + EN)

### close-stale-issues

#### Description

This workflow automatically identifies inactive issues and pull requests and marks them as ‚Äústale‚Äù after a period 
without activity. If there is no interaction after being marked, they are automatically closed. All messages are 
bilingual (Portuguese + English) to facilitate communication with contributors.

#### Triggers

- `schedule` (cron: `00 4 * * *`)
- `workflow_dispatch` (manual run)

#### Messages

- Message for issue marked as stale:
  - Explains that the issue had 45 days without activity and will be closed in 15 days if there is no interaction
  - Bilingual (PT-BR + EN)

- Message for PR marked as stale:
  - Explains that the PR had 30 days without activity and will be closed in 15 days if there is no interaction
  - Bilingual (PT-BR + EN)

- Message when closing issue:
  - Summarizes the timeline: marked as inactive after 45 days, closed after an additional 15 days
  - Provides next steps (reopen, update context, create a new issue if necessary)
  - Bilingual (PT-BR + EN)

- Message when closing PR:
  - Summarizes the timeline: marked as inactive after 30 days, closed after an additional 15 days
  - Provides next steps (reopen, address reviews, rebase/merge with main)
  - Bilingual (PT-BR + EN)

#### Behavior summary

- Every day at 04:00 (UTC in cron `00 4 * * *`), the workflow evaluates issues and PRs:
  - Issues: marked as stale after 45 days without activity; closed after an additional 15 days (bilingual messages)
  - PRs: marked as stale after 30 days without activity; closed after an additional 15 days (bilingual messages)
- Can be run manually via `workflow_dispatch`
- Posts clear comments with instructions on what to do to keep it open (remove the stale label or comment)

#### Changelog

- **v1** ‚Äî Initial release
  - Implements automatic inactivity marking (stale) for issues (45 days) and PRs (30 days)
  - Automatically closes after an additional 15 days without response
  - Includes bilingual messages for marking and closing issues/PRs
  - Daily scheduling via cron and manual run support

### validate-pr-title

#### Description

Ensures that pull request titles follow the
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.
If the title doesn‚Äôt match the expected format, the workflow posts a bilingual (Portuguese +
English) comment explaining the problem, giving examples of valid prefixes, and linking to the
official docs for guidance. Once the title is fixed, the comment is automatically removed.

#### Triggers

- `workflow_call`
- `pull_request` (opened, edited, reopened)

#### Behavior summary

- Validates PR titles against the allowed list of Conventional Commit types:
  - `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `revert`, `style`, `test`
- If invalid:
  - Fails the check
  - Posts a sticky comment with context, examples, and links in both PT-BR and EN
- If valid:
  - Removes any previous error comment
- Helps maintain a clean, standardized project history, improving automation (e.g., changelogs,
  releases)

#### Changelog

- **v1** ‚Äî Initial release.
  - Enforces allowed Conventional Commit types (`chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`,
    `style`, `test`)
  - Adds bilingual guidance for contributors when the title is invalid
  - Automatically cleans up guidance comments once the title is fixed
